This is a to-do list tracker. It allows users to create, complete and delete tasks from a list.

## User stories
#### As a busy person, I want to:

- [x] Add tasks to a list so that I can keep track of them

- [x] Check things off my list so that I can see what I’ve done

- [x] Delete things from the list if I don’t need to do them anymore

#### As a motor-impaired user, I want to:

- [x] Use all the features of the app without a mouse

## Stretch 
### As a busy person, I want to:

- [x] See completed to-do filtered out from my list so that I can focus on what’s left to do
###### Optional
- [ ] To do list is stored on the local storage so I can review it many times 
- [ ] To do app lets you create different to-do lists e.g. shopping, chores, work tasks, etc.
---
## Acceptance Criteria 
- [x] A working to-do list
- [ ] Tests for (at least) each user story
- [ ] A responsive, mobile-first design
- [ ] Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible
